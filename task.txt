(FastAPI + React) role and I’m impressed with your background.

As a next step, I’d like to share a small take-home assignment:

Build a small web app used by an investment team to move deals through a pipeline.

Scope (what to build)
1) Auth + Roles
* Email/password auth
* Roles:
 * Admin: manage users + full access
 * Analyst: create/edit deals + IC memos
 * Partner: can comment, vote, and approve/decline
2) Deal Pipeline (Kanban)
* Stages: Sourced → Screen → Diligence → IC → Invested → Passed
* UI: Kanban board with drag-and-drop stage changes
* Deal fields: name, company_url, owner, stage, round, check_size, status, created_at, updated_at
* Stage change must create an Activity record (e.g., “Analyst moved X from Screen to Diligence”)
3) IC Memo (simple, structured editor)
* Sections (fixed list): Summary, Market, Product, Traction, Risks, Open Questions
* Each section is markdown/plain text
* Versioning: every save creates a new version row (store full memo snapshot)
* UI: “Version history” + view older versions (read-only)
Tech stack
* Backend: FastAPI
* Frontend: React
* DB: Postgres preferred (SQLite acceptable)
